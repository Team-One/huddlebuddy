  "readme": "# pre-commit\n\nA simple `pre-commit` hook installer for `git`. This will make sure that your\ntest suite passes before you can commit your changes. In addition to running\nyour `npm test` it also has the option to run custom scripts that you have\nspecified in your `package.json`.\n\n### Installation\n\nIt's adviced to install this module as `devDependency` in your `package.json`\nfile so it doesn't get installed on production servers. Run:\n\n```\nnpm install pre-commit --save-dev\n```\n\nTo install it as `devDependency`.\n\n### Configuration\n\n`pre-commit` will try to run your `npm test` command by default. It does this by\nrunning `npm run test` in the root of your git repository. It will only run that\ncommand if it's not the default values that are entered when you issue an `npm\ninit`.\n\nBut `pre-commit` is not limited to just running your `npm test`'s during the\ncommit hook. It's also capable of running every other script that you've\nspecified in your `package.json` \"scripts\" field. The only thing you need to do\nis add a `pre-commit` array to your `package.json` that specifies which scripts\nyou want to have ran and in which order:\n\n```js\n{\n  \"name\": \"437464d0899504fb6b7b\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.0\",\n  \"description\": \"ERROR: No README.md file found!\",\n  \"main\": \"index.js\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"echo \\\"Error: no test specified\\\" && exit 1\",\n    \"foo\": \"echo \\\"fooo\\\" && exit 0\",\n    \"bar\": \"echo \\\"bar\\\" && exit 0\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": {\n    \"type\": \"git\",\n    \"url\": \"https://gist.github.com/437464d0899504fb6b7b.git\"\n  },\n  \"pre-commit\": [\n    \"foo\",\n    \"bar\",\n    \"test\"\n  ],\n  \"author\": \"\",\n  \"license\": \"BSD\",\n  \"gitHead\": \"6637d0771c3a89c4a60be087859dee5130f7a104\"\n}\n```\n\nIn the example above, it will first run: `npm run foo` then `npm run bar` and\nfinally `npm run test` which will make the commit fail as it returns the error\ncode `1`.\n\nTo learn more about the scripts, please read the offical `npm` documentation:\n\nhttps://npmjs.org/doc/scripts.html\n\n### License\n\nMIT\n",
